How to run BAM with TPA.
1. You need Future Pinball running with BAM with any head tracking method working. 
2. Exit FP and run BAM-Tracker.exe (from BAM dir).
3. Select head tracking method (on this video: Kinect 2)
4. Run Launcher.exe to load TPA in DX9. Play.
Next time you don't need to run FP and select head tracking method.

DX11 is not supported.
Without BAM-Tracker (and whole FP/BAM stuffs) BAM_for_TPA will work in Static Cam mode. 
You will be able to setup table possition and camera/viewer position almost same way as in FP/BAM.

---------------------------------------
Manual for BAM in TPA.
There is no menu on screen. You need to remember all keyboard keys.
Full list of keys:
F11 - Next preset
F10 - Prev preset
F9 - Turn on/off head tracking

F8 - Setup-mode On. Flying camera. (It helps to setup table).
F7 - Setup-mode On. Normal camera (head tracking or static)
F6 - Setup-mode Off. Arrow keys not active.

F5 - Save current preset to "CurrentPreset.txt" 
F4 - Restore preset. (Remove all changes)

F3 - Step = Step / 10; (decress step for every tuned params)
F2 - Step = 1; (reset step to default value)
F1 - Step = Step * 10; (increass step for every tuned params)

In Setup-mode (After F7 or F8):
Arrows Left/Right : Table Angle
Arrows Up/Down: Move table up/down.
PageUp/PageDown: Move table forward/backward
Home/End: Scale table (make bigger/smaller)

So you have 4 params to tune, used to set in-game virtual table in relation to screen.
That for values i call "preset".
In file "Presets.txt" you may find 3 sets of that values. You may add more or modify it.

When you press F5 "CurrentPreset.txt" is created. You may copy values from here to "Preset.txt".

When Setup-mode is disabled (after F6, F9, F10, F11) and when head tracking is disabled, camera is paced in user defined position.
You may change that position with PageUp/PageDown & Home/End keys.

There is file "Settings.txt" with static camera position. You may change it.

------------------------------------------

What if you don't have FP/BAM running?
You may use "static camera". (no head tracking).
In that case first look at "Settings.txt". Here you need to enter: your display size and native resolution. If you use BAM/FP headtracking that information is taken from FP/BAM setup.
